jezyaml
=======

Java EasyYaml - **jezyaml** is a light wrapper for reading [YAML][YAML] in Java. It uses [snakeyaml][snakeyaml] to load YAML from a String or a File. **jezyaml** provides easy APIs to get values defined in YAML.

Currently the project is in initial development phase. Gradually I shall add more features and more description about the project and its usage.
